This the RSS data and matlab files for the IPS paper.

Directories:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+map:	rss for 72 reference locations
+mat:	it's data warehouse which stores the database, map, coordiantes,etc.
+multi:	rss manipulation, include data of 5 power leves with 9 distances
+three: rss manipulation for 3 power level: low, median, high. Don't use it in the experiment.
+twin:	twin ap test, not use
+userdata: includes the 360 user test rss data
